# Guideline for Pull Request
1. Always create a separate branch for any changes that you are working on. While creating a pull request, create a pull request from your-branch to master branch. Do not directly push to master
2. Always squash your commits to a single commit before creating a PR.
3. You commit message should be self explanatory.
